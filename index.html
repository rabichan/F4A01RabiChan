		<h1> Hello, I am Rabi.</h1>
		<p>I am a F4 student in Sacred Heart Canossian College (English Section) in Macau and I am studying science now.</p>
		<p>I see myself as a relentless problem-solver, and I’m always looking for a new challenge. I am interested in science.</p>
		<p>My strength is my attitude that I like to take the challenge that I can do it, self-taught, autonomous I have a good team player as well as I have a great ability to lead the team. I can accept any type of environment. I’m a good listener and a quick peek.</p>
		<p>My wish is to be a doctor because it is a great job which can save a lot of people. </p>
		<p>As for my interests, I like to play table tennis and squash which make me to feel relaxed and happy.</p>
